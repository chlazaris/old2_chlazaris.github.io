# Biography

I am a Bioinformatics Scientist in the [Young Laboratory](http://younglab.wi.mit.edu/) at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research. My research interests include the role of nuclear organization in gene expression and mechanisms of transcriptional dysregulation in cancer. I earned my Ph.D. at the NYU School of Medicine, under the supervision of Drs. Iannis Aifantis and Aristotelis Tsirigos. During my Ph.D. research, I focused on genetic alterations of topologically associating domain (TAD) boundaries and their link with aberrant oncogene activation in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A full copy of my Ph.D. dissertation can be found on Proquest (Number 10640945). For updates, you can also visit my [MIT website](https://lazaris.mit.edu/) or follow my blog by subscribing to this [RSS feed](https://chlazaris.github.io/post/index.xml).
