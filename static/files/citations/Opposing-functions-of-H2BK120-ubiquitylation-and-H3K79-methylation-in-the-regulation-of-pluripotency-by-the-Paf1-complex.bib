abstract = {Maintenance of stem cell plasticity is determined by the ability to balance opposing forces that control gene expression. Regulation of transcriptional networks, signaling cues and chromatin-modifying mechanisms constitute crucial determinants of tissue equilibrium. Histone modifications can affect chromatin compaction, therefore co-transcriptional events that influence their deposition determine the propensities toward quiescence, self-renewal, or cell specification. The Paf1 complex ({Paf1C}) is a critical regulator of {RNA} {PolII} elongation that controls gene expression and deposition of histone modifications, however few studies have focused on its role affecting stem cell fate decisions. Here we delineate the functions of {Paf1C} in pluripotency and characterize its impact in deposition of {H2B} ubiquitylation ({H2BK120}-ub) and {H3K79} methylation ({H3K79me}), 2 fundamental histone marks that shape transcriptional regulation. We identify that {H2BK120}-ub is increased in the absence of {Paf1C} on its embryonic stem cell targets, in sharp contrast to {H3K79me}, suggesting opposite functions in the maintenance of self-renewal. Furthermore, we found that core pluripotency genes are characterized by a dual gain of {H2BK120}-ub and loss of {H3K79me} on their gene bodies. Our findings elucidate molecular mechanisms of cellular adaptation and reveal novel functions of {Paf1C} in the regulation of the self-renewal network.}
