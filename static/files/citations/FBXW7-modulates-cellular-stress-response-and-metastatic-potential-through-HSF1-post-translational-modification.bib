abstract = {​Heat-shock factor 1 (​{HSF1}) orchestrates the heat-shock response in eukaryotes. Although this pathway has evolved to help cells adapt in the presence of challenging conditions, it is co-opted in cancer to support malignancy. However, the mechanisms that regulate ​{HSF1} and thus cellular stress response are poorly understood. Here we show that the ubiquitin ligase ​{FBXW7\alpha} interacts with ​{HSF1} through a conserved motif phosphorylated by ​{GSK3\beta} and ​{ERK1}. ​{FBXW7\alpha} ubiquitylates ​{HSF1} and loss of ​{FBXW7\alpha} results in impaired degradation of nuclear ​{HSF1} and defective heat-shock response attenuation. ​{FBXW7\alpha} is either mutated or transcriptionally downregulated in melanoma and ​{HSF1} nuclear stabilization correlates with increased metastatic potential and disease progression. ​{FBXW7\alpha} deficiency and subsequent ​{HSF1} accumulation activates an invasion-supportive transcriptional program and enhances the metastatic potential of human melanoma cells. These findings identify a post-translational mechanism of regulation of the ​{HSF1} transcriptional program both in the presence of exogenous stress and in cancer.}
