abstract = {Low-grade astrocytomas ({LGAs}) carry neomorphic mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase ({IDH}) concurrently with P53 and {ATRX} loss. To model {LGA} formation, we introduced {R132H} {IDH1}, P53 {shRNA}, and {ATRX} {shRNA} into human neural stem cells ({NSCs}). These oncogenic hits blocked {NSC} differentiation, increased invasiveness inÂ vivo, and led to a {DNA} methylation and transcriptional profile resembling {IDH1} mutant human {LGAs}. The differentiation block was caused by transcriptional silencing of the transcription factor {SOX2} secondary to disassociation of its promoter from a putative enhancer. This occurred because of reduced binding of the chromatin organizer {CTCF} to its {DNA} motifs and disrupted chromatin looping. Our human model of {IDH} mutant {LGA} formation implicates impaired {NSC} differentiation because of repression of {SOX2} as an early driver of gliomagenesis. Copyright \copyright 2017 The Author(s).
