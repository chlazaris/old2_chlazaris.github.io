abstract = {Pluripotent embryonic stem cells ({ESCs}) self-renew or differentiate into all tissues of the developing embryo and cell-specification factors are necessary to balance gene expression. Here we delineate the function of the {PHD}-finger protein 5a (Phf5a) in {ESC} self-renewal and ascribe its role in regulating pluripotency, cellular reprogramming and myoblast specification. We demonstrate that Phf5a is essential for maintaining pluripotency, since depleted {ESCs} exhibit hallmarks of differentiation. Mechanistically, we attribute Phf5a function to the stabilization of the Paf1 transcriptional complex and control of {RNA} polymerase {II} elongation on pluripotency loci. Apart from an {ESC}-specific factor, we demonstrate that Phf5a controls differentiation of adult myoblasts. Our findings suggest a potent mode of regulation by Phf5a in stem cells, which directs their transcriptional programme, ultimately regulating maintenance of pluripotency and cellular reprogramming.}
