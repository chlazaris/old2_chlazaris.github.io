abstract = {Cellular transformation is accompanied by extensive rewiring of many biological processes leading to augmented levels of distinct types of cellular stress, including proteotoxic stress. Cancer cells critically depend on stress-relief pathways for their survival. However, the mechanisms underlying the transcriptional initiation and maintenance of the oncogenic stress response remain elusive. Here, we show that the expression of heat shock transcription factor 1 ({HSF1}) and the downstream mediators of the heat shock response is transcriptionally upregulated in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-{ALL}). Hsf1 ablation suppresses the growth of human T-{ALL} and eradicates leukemia in mouse models of T-{ALL}, while sparing normal hematopoiesis. {HSF1} drives a compact transcriptional program and among the direct {HSF1} targets, specific chaperones and co-chaperones mediate its critical role in T-{ALL}. Notably, we demonstrate that the central T-{ALL} oncogene {NOTCH1} hijacks the cellular stress response machinery by inducing the expression of {HSF1} and its downstream effectors. The {NOTCH1} signaling status controls the levels of chaperone/co-chaperone complexes and predicts the response of T-{ALL} patient samples to {HSP90} inhibition. Our data demonstrate an integral crosstalk between mediators of oncogene and non-oncogene addiction and reveal critical nodes of the heat shock response pathway that can be targeted therapeutically.}
