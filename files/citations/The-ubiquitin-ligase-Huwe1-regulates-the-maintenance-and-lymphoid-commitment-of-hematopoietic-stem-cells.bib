abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cells ({HSCs}) are dormant in the bone marrow and can be activated in response to diverse stresses to replenish all blood cell types. We identified the ubiquitin ligase Huwe1 as a crucial regulator of {HSC} function via its post-translational control of the oncoprotein N-myc (encoded by Mycn). We found Huwe1 to be essential for {HSC} self-renewal, quiescence and lymphoid-fate specification in mice. Through the use of a fluorescent fusion allele ({MycnM}), we observed that N-myc expression was restricted to the most immature, multipotent stem and progenitor populations. N-myc expression was upregulated in response to stress or following loss of Huwe1, which led to increased proliferation and stem-cell exhaustion. Mycn depletion reversed most of these phenotypes in vivo, which suggested that the attenuation of N-myc by Huwe1 is essential for reestablishing homeostasis following stress.}
