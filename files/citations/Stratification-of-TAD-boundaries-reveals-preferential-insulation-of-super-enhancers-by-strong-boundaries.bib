abstract = {The metazoan genome is compartmentalized in areas of highly interacting chromatin known as topologically associating domains ({TADs}). {TADs} are demarcated by boundaries mostly conserved across cell types and even across species. However, a genome-wide characterization of {TAD} boundary strength in mammals is still lacking. In this study, we first use fused two-dimensional lasso as a machine learning method to improve Hi-C contact matrix reproducibility, and, subsequently, we categorize {TAD} boundaries based on their insulation score. We demonstrate that higher {TAD} boundary insulation scores are associated with elevated {CTCF} levels and that they may differ across cell types. Intriguingly, we observe that super-enhancers are preferentially insulated by strong boundaries. Furthermore, we demonstrate that strong {TAD} boundaries and super-enhancer elements are frequently co-duplicated in cancer patients. Taken together, our findings suggest that super-enhancers insulated by strong {TAD} boundaries may be exploited, as a functional unit, by cancer cells to promote oncogenesis.}
