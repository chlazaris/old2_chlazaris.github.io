abstract = {Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is a heterogeneous group of lymphomas characterized by the accumulation of malignant T cells in the skin. The molecular and cellular etiology of this malignancy remains enigmatic, and what role antigenic stimulation plays in the initiation and/or progression of the disease remains to be elucidated. Deep sequencing of the tumor genome showed a highly heterogeneous landscape of genetic perturbations, and transcriptome analysis of transformed T cells further highlighted the heterogeneity of this disease. Nonetheless, using data harvested from high-throughput transcriptional profiling allowed us to develop a reliable signature of this malignancy. Focusing on a key cytokine signaling pathway previously implicated in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma pathogenesis, {JAK}/{STAT} signaling, we used conditional gene targeting to develop a fully penetrant small animal model of this disease that recapitulates many key features of mycosis fungoides, a common variant of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Using this mouse model, we show that T-cell receptor engagement is critical for malignant transformation of the T lymphocytes and that progression of the disease is dependent on microbiota.
